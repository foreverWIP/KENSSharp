The evil genius scientist Doctor Eggman has embraced his evil schemes again.
"Sonic... that annoying, cocky hedgehog. Thanks to him, my great plans are always ruined. Oh, but this time, I'm going to crush him with the power of my science! Ha ha ha..."

South Island is a treasure trove of gems and ancient ruins. It's also said to be the island where the mystical "Chaos Emeralds" lay dormant. The Chaos Emeralds are a super substance that give energy to all living beings. Also, though science and technology, they can be used for nuclear and laser weapons. But nobody knows how to get them. This is because South Island is a moving island, and the Chaos Emeralds exist within the distortions created by the island.

One day, crisis came upon the island. Doctor Eggman and his crew have landed on the island.
"Huh. I'll make sure to find the Chaos Emeralds, even if I'll have to dig up the whole island."
Doctor Eggman built a huge fortress on one corner of the island and embarked on his plan.

"Eggman. You still haven't had enough?!"
Sonic rushed over after he heard the rumors. Doctor Eggman's harassment is a regular occurence. He has been dealt with every time so far. Doctor Eggman seems to consider Sonic his sworn enemy, but he was never any match for Sonic.

But, oh my... something is amiss.
"Look, Sonic! This time it's different. I turned the Animals on the island into robots."
"E...Everyone!"
"All of these guys move in accordance to my orders. In other words, the whole island is your enemy! Gya ha ha ha ha ha ha... cough cough. This time, the world will be all mine."

This is terrible! Go! Sonic the Hedgehog. Everyone is waiting for your help.
